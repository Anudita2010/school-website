                            <p> From 6 -10th January 2021, IIT Roorkee, in collaboration with Clever Harvey, held their E-summit Entrepreneurship event. Participants had to come up with a novel, feasible business idea and pitch it to potential investors. After a social media round where 16 out of hundreds of teams were selected, 2 teams from our school did us proud. Janav Arun and Preksha Tyagi came first overall with their portal to help children with special needs. They earned a cash prize of Rs. 25,000, a sit down with the CEO of Clever Harvey and an opportunity to pitch their idea at IIM Udaipur. Shreyas Bachiraju and Pragadeeshwar Kannan were the first runners up, with their driver safety system, Drive Safe. They too were awarded an opportunity to pitch their idea at IIM Udaipur as well as a meeting with the project head of Clever Harvey.</p>

                                Landmarks 2021, the virtual social science extravaganza organised by Grade 4 of NPS INR was quite the 'Pandora's Box' of cultural presentations. Held on 13 March 2021 entirely via the online platform MS Teams, the event did not fail to entertain guests, parents and all who attended it.

                                Focus being on 'Unity in Diversity', the children presented models of various landforms, types of music and dance, traditional wear of states of India and also gave the viewers a lot of interesting information about our country-India. It stressed on the fact that inspite of our varied backgrounds and disparate cultures, we as Indians are ONE. To up the excitement, a live quiz was organised for the parents.

                                The event also showed that in spite of the challenging year we have just been through, with teachers, children and parents having to improvise, innovate and recalibrate, learning has always taken precedence. As always NPS INR standards kept high.

                            For more than 40 years, NPS INR has evolved in many ways while still retaining its charm from the 80s. The batch of 2020 has therefore attempted to capture the school as it stands today through a 3D render of it on Minecraft. It includes all the aspects of the school, such as the 5 buildings, the basketball court, water area, and more - all down to the minutest details. If you want more than just a tour, there’s also an in-game treasure hunt which highlights the lesser known spaces on campus.
